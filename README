MPRESS Packer dumper

This is a MPRESS dumper utility as described in my Shakacon'14 presentation.
(http://reverse.put.as/2014/06/26/shakacon-6-presentation-fuck-you-hacking-team-from-portugal-with-love/)

At the moment it only supports dumping of 32 bits targets. You can finish the 64 bits targets support ;-).

Not a spectacular example of Cocoa code, I definitely suck at it and the whole design could be much better.
In particular how dumping integrates with the GUI and returns unpacking result.

Feel free to improve this and submit your patches. 
Right now I don't have much time to make this something better :-(.

Uses Capstone for all disassembling needs.

Since this is a custom debugger it needs to be codesigned to run in latest OS X versions!
Don't forget to modify the Xcode project to point to your certificate.

You should run this in a VM if trying to unpack malware code since it needs to execute the code to unpack
and dump.

Enjoy,
fG!
